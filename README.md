# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression

A Shallow Neural Network was built using Keras and Tensorflow (backend) in python to solve a Multiple Linear Regression problem. House Prices were predicted using this NN. The data consisted of 5000 entries and 6 Features. Seaborn was used for data visualization. Entries were standardized before using them for training the NN. The model had 4 Dense layers and 1000 epochs were carried for training the model.

Training MAE: 0.413

Validation MAE: 0.430

Testing MAE: 0.436
